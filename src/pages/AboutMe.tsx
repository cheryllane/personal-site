            <h2>Hi, I'm Cheryl.</h2>
            <p>I'm quickly passionate about anything I do.</p>
            <p>
                I'm excellent at Googling, at pulling apart a puzzle, at
                bringing others along for the journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                I bring a new perspective and can see an edge case at 20 paces.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've a great memory for that weird issue we fixed 2 years ago.
            </p>
            <h3>Outside of work</h3>
            <p>I've a lot of hobbies, including those that have tools here.</p>
            <p>Among others, I've been doing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Gardening (I'm vice chair of my local allotment committee)
                </li>
                <li>Leatherworking</li>
                <li>
                    Reading (currently rereading the Stormlight Archive series)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exploring new tech (this is written in Vite/React, but I
                    wrote a previous version in Gatsby, and initially wrote the
                    Killer tool in vanilla js)
                </li>
                <li>Crocheting (ask me about my desk ghosts!)</li>
                <li>Sewing</li>
                <li>Cross stitch</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
